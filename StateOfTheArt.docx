The kitchen is a complex and dangerous multi-user work environment that can benefit from augmented reality techniques to help people cook more safely, easily and efficiently. With this type of software it can be helped a chef at a local restaurant or people who are still learning to dice an onion or boil water. 

Most of the applications create a virtual place to exchange recipes with friends, family, and strangers.We can upload a recipe with a picture of the finished dish and others can comment or a give a number of stars for rating. Recipes are also sorted into different categories and the app creates a profile for yourself, so you can see what others have uploaded and liked.

 Some of the apps also allows you to manage your shopping lists and recipes across platforms, and even perform voice-activated commands that are specifically designed for hands-free cooking. Another can connect with sensors to set time and temperature and when the meal is done it announces you.
