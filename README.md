 Summary:
- We want to develop an application that will contain elements of augmented reality in the gastronomic field
- The application will handle a list of recipients (ingredients, quantities, preparation mode (text, pictures, video))
- For ingredients identification part we will use the AR component and for the preparation mode (verbal indications or video films) we will use voice commands (start, stop, pause, back, forward - Alexa), the iris movement or the hand gestures
